## Notes

- No requirements needed when taking this course.
- Recommend that you watch all of these videos through once without touching the keyboard. Just take notes. Then watch them a second time and follow along and change/break the code and review the bits that you need.
- Download or clone the source code: [**Course Repo**](https://github.com/kentcdodds/beginners-guide-to-react/tree/egghead).

* Copy and paste the `start` script in a terminal window to locally serve all the files. Access the files in `localhost:3000`.

  - `npx browser-sync start --server --files "./*.html" --no-open --no-notify --directory`
  - `npx` comes bundled with Node.js
  - browsersync automatically reloads any changes made to the code.
  - More info on [browsersync](https://github.com/wesbos/browser-sync-remote-example)
